# Code Location

The code is available at: https://github.com/mk6502/supervised-learning/

# Usage

I used Python 3.9 installed via Anaconda. The code should work with Python 3.6-3.8 too but I have not tested those.

Install required packages (standard scientific Python packages) with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the code with:

    python main.py

This will run for somewhere on the order of 15-60 minutes depending on the hardware.
All learners, hyperparameter grid search, and plotting all happens by running `main.py`.
Plots are output to the `plots` directory. Various metrics are printed to the console.
