# Code Location

The code is available at: https://github.com/mk6502/supervised-learning/

# Usage

I used Python 3.9 installed via Anaconda.

Install required packages with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the code with:

    python main.py

This will run for about 5-10 minutes. All learners, hyperparameter grid search, and plotting all happens by running
`main.py`. Plots are output to the `plots` directory. Various metrics are printed to the console.
